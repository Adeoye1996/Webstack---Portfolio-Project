School Website Project

This is a School Website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) along with Material-UI for styling. The website includes pages for Home, About, Academics, Admissions, Student Life, Contact, News and Events, Resources, and a Login Portal for parents, staff, and administrators.

The site is fully responsive and can be accessed on all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
